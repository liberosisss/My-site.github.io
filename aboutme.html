            I don't really like to talk about myself, 
            so I don't want to divulge some of my personal information 
            (such as name, age, my nationality, etc.) 
            I think I appreciate it more when people are interested in 
            my projects than in my personal life. 
            However, since we're on this page, 
            I suppose I should share some information about myself. <br>
            So, in my free time, I like to draw and daydream. 
            I have many different hobbies, for example, wood carving, 
            scrapbooking and doing jigsaw puzzles. 
            I also enjoy basic things like listening to music and playing computer games. <br> 
            My favorite music bands are Reel Big Fish, 
            Sounds of Salvation, Deluxtone Rockets, 
            The Aquabats and The Pietasters. 
            As you probably already guessed, I love ska music. <br> 
            My favorite games are Subnautica, The Binding of Isaac, 
            Balatro, Portal 2, Picayune Dreams and Pixel Dungeon. 
            I recently bought Mewgenics and I hope it will be good. 
            At the moment, I'm learning C# to make my own games. 
            They will all be free and available on this website or on itch.io <br> 
            Besides all of the above, I'm also interested in indie animation.
